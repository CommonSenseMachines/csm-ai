CSM Python API Library
===============================

CSM provides a custom `Python library <https://github.com/CommonSenseMachines/csm-ai>`_ to enhance access to our tools and accelerate workflows for designers and developers who use the widely-popular Python programming language. The Python library serves as a wrapper of our REST API and provides convenience functions to make 3d content creation easy and lightning-fast. For information about API keys, credit allocation, and more please refer to the `REST API documentation <https://docs.csm.ai/>`_.
