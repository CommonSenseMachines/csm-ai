# Documentation website for csm-python

To build the documentation site, first make sure that you have installed the necessary build requirements (see `requirements.txt`). Then, from the docs directory run the following command:

    sphinx-build -M html source/ build/

API documentation will be automatically generated for the `csm` python package.
